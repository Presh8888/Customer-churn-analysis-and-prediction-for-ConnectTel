The customer churn analysis project for ConnectTel began with data cleaning to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis. This involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing formats to ensure consistency.

Key Steps in the Project:

Data Cleaning: Started by thoroughly cleaning the data to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and prepare the data for analysis. This step was crucial in ensuring accurate and reliable results.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the relationships between various features and customer churn. Visualizations such as pair plots and heatmaps were used to identify significant patterns and correlations.

Feature Engineering: Converted categorical variables into numerical values and created new features to enhance model performance, based on insights gained during EDA.

Model Development and Evaluation: Developed and tested multiple machine learning modelsâ€”Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The Gradient Boosting model emerged as the most effective with an accuracy of 79.53%.

Insights and Recommendations: The analysis identified key drivers of churn and provided actionable insights for ConnectTel to implement targeted retention strategies.

Conclusion: The project successfully leveraged data cleaning, analysis, and machine learning to predict customer churn, providing ConnectTel with valuable insights to improve customer retention and minimize churn rates.
